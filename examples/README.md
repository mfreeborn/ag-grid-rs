# Examples

## How to Run
All the examples can be built locally using [Trunk](https://trunkrs.dev/). For instance, the following command builds and serves the `datasource`` example:

```bash
cd examples/datasource-yew
trunk serve
```

Now open up `localhost:8080` in your browser to see the live example.
